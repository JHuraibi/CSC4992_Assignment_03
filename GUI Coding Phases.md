GUI Coding Phases

1. Define a new class to represent the main window
2. Instantiate the classes of window objects needed for this application (e.g., labels, command buttons)
3. Position these components in the window
4. Instantiate the data model and provide any default data in the window objects
5. Register controller methods with each window object in which a relevant event might occur
6. Define these controller methods
7. Define a main that launches the GUI
